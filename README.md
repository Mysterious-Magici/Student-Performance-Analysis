README: Student Performance Analytics & Educational Insights
Overview

This project analyzes student academic performance using demographic, behavioral, and educational factors to uncover key drivers of exam outcomes. Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, the study converts raw student data into meaningful insights to support data-driven educational decision-making.

Project Objectives

Performance Distribution Analysis: Understand overall exam score patterns and identify common performance ranges.

Academic Behavior Impact: Evaluate the influence of study hours, attendance, sleep, and prior scores on exam performance.

Socio-Economic Factors: Assess the role of parental involvement, education level, and family income.

Learning Environment Evaluation: Analyze the impact of internet access, tutoring sessions, teacher quality, and school type.

Holistic Development: Examine the effect of motivation, peer influence, extracurricular activities, and physical activity.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data analysis and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing categorical values using an “Unknown” category for consistency.

Visualization Techniques: Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar charts, regression plots, heatmaps, and pie charts.

Key Features & Insights

Performance Concentration: Most students score between 60–70, indicating a dominant performance band.

Strong Predictors: Attendance, hours studied, and previous scores show a strong positive correlation with exam results.

Behavioral Factors: Adequate sleep and higher motivation levels contribute to improved academic performance.

Parental Influence: Higher parental involvement and education levels are associated with better median exam scores.

Learning Resources: Students with internet access and tutoring support demonstrate higher performance with reduced score variability.

School & Teaching Quality: Private schools and higher teacher quality show a slight performance advantage.

Peer & Extracurricular Impact: Positive peer influence and participation in extracurricular activities support competitive exam outcomes.

Equity & Accessibility: Gender distribution is nearly balanced, and distance from home shows minimal impact on exam scores.
